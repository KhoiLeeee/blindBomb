# 🎮 BlindBomB

**BlindBomB** is a fast-paced, grid-based bomb battle game developed in Unity and C#. Inspired by the classic *Bomb It* series, BlindBomB introduces an exciting twist to the genre — **randomized explosion ranges**, adding unpredictability and requiring players to adapt and strategize on the fly.

## 🎯 Game Overview

BlindBomB is a 2D desktop game where players compete on a destructible map, placing bombs, collecting power-ups, and outsmarting their opponents — human or AI. Whether you're playing a casual match or a chaotic free-for-all, BlindBomB offers endless fun with no two games alike.
